<h2>Description</h2>
In this Networking Project I will design a network in Cisco Packet Tracer to connect ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments through the following:
Each department should contain at least two PCs. Appropriate number of switches and routers should be used in the network.
Using the given network 192.168.40.0, all interfaces sould be configured with correct IP addresses, subnet mask and gateways.
All devices in the network should be connected using appropriate cables. The last step will be to test communication between devices in both ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments.
